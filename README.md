# steam_api64.retro

A drop-in `steam_api64.dll` for the legacy Steam builds of No Man's Sky (up to
1.38, Atlas Rises) that lets them run without the Steam client. It replaces the
Steamless plus Goldberg emulator combination the
[NMS Retro installer](https://github.com/NoMansSkyRetro/Installer) used to apply.

It does two jobs:

1. **Unwraps the SteamStub DRM in memory.** Builds from Path Finder (1.2x)
   onwards ship with the Steam DRM wrapper, which leaves the game's code
   encrypted on disk. The wrapper's own loader talks to `steamclient64.dll`
   directly, so it cannot be satisfied from `steam_api64.dll`. Instead, at load
   time the DLL decrypts the code section with the key that sits in the stub
   header and redirects the entry point to the game's original one. `NMS.exe`
   stays untouched on disk.
2. **Answers the Steamworks calls these builds make.** Steam ID, persona name,
   language, app ownership, achievements (kept for the session), a working
   callback queue for `SteamInternal_ContextInit` style clients, and harmless
   zero answers for everything else (Workshop, lobbies, voice, Steam Controller).

Two optional extras, both off by default: skipping the mods-enabled warning
screen, and sending the game's discoveries traffic to a server of your choice.

## Build compatibility

The DLL no longer refuses executables just because their PE timestamp is newer
than 1.38. Timestamp-based default settings are still selected by matching known
build timestamps in `DEFAULT_IDS`.

## Install and settings

Copy `steam_api64.dll` over the one in the game's `Binaries` folder. On first
run the DLL writes `steam_api64.txt` next to itself; edit it as you like:

```
steamid=138
savesteamid=138
name=Player
language=english
disablemodwarning=false
discoveriesserver=
```

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `steamid` | Any number. The Steam ID the game is told it is signed in as, and what it reports to the discoveries server. |
| `savesteamid` | The ID the save system uses instead: it names the save folder `%APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\st_<savesteamid>` and forms part of the save encryption key. Defaults to `steamid`. |
| `name` | Persona name reported by Steam. Also sent as `user` to the discoveries server. |
| `language` | Game language reported by Steam. |
| `disablemodwarning` | `true` skips the "mods enabled" screen shown at boot once `PCBANKS\DISABLEMODS.TXT` is removed. 1.13 and later; 1.09.1 has no mod system. |
| `discoveriesserver` | `http://host:port` or `https://host[:port]`. Empty keeps the game pointed at Hello Games (whose 1.x servers are gone). |

The default is the version number for the four builds the installer ships (109,
113, 124, 138) so each build keeps its own saves, and 0 for any other build. The
installer writes your real Steam ID as `steamid` and leaves `savesteamid` on the
version number. Give two builds the same `savesteamid` to share one set of saves
between them, and set it to the 17-digit ID a Goldberg-era folder is named after
to keep those saves.

### Save Steam ID

The game asks Steam for its ID once, hands it to the save manager, and then uses
it both to name the `st_<id>` folder and as part of the key the save files are
encrypted with, so a save belongs to whichever ID was live when it was written.
When `savesteamid` differs from `steamid` the DLL patches the one instruction
that reads the returned ID - the `mov rax,[rsp+disp]` right after the
`GetSteamID` call, told apart from the other call sites by the "ID present" flag
stored just after it - to return `savesteamid` instead. Every other use of the ID
still sees the real one. One call site in 1.09.1 and 1.13, where the save and
cache managers share a constructor, and two in 1.24 and 1.38, where it is inlined
into both.

To get a log, create an empty `steam_api64.retro.log` next to the DLL. The log
lists every interface the game asks for, the first call to any slot the DLL
does not implement, and everything the two extras do.

### Mod warning

The pak loader sets a "mods loaded" flag after mounting `PCBANKS\MODS`, and the
boot screens show the warning only when it is set. With `disablemodwarning=true`
the DLL finds the instruction that stores the flag (one unique byte pattern in
1.13, 1.24 and 1.38) and makes it store 0 instead. Mods still load; nothing else
reads the flag. If the pattern is not found exactly once the DLL leaves the game
alone and says so in the log.

### Discoveries server

These builds authenticate against `pc-nms-auth.nomanssky.com` with a Steam auth
ticket and take every other endpoint from the `routes` in that reply, so
redirecting the auth connection is enough to move the whole discoveries flow.
With `discoveriesserver` set the DLL hooks the game's WinHTTP imports, sends any
connection to a Hello Games host to your server instead (scheme and port from
the setting, HTTPS without certificate checks), and hands the game an auth
ticket it would otherwise not get without Steam.

[DISCOVERIES-SERVER.md](DISCOVERIES-SERVER.md) documents the request and reply
formats, the ticket layout, the route table per build, and what a real server
would need. `tools\dummy_discoveries_server.py` is a logging dummy server to
start from.

## Build

Run `build.bat` with Visual Studio 2019 or newer installed (it finds the
toolset through vswhere). Output is `build\steam_api64.dll`. The only
dependencies are user32, bcrypt and winhttp, all part of Windows.

`python tests\check.py` verifies the exports, the cap, and the default IDs
against the executables under `E:\NMSLegacy`.

## Credits

No code from either project is included, but neither part of this DLL would
exist without them:

- [Steamless](https://github.com/atom0s/Steamless) by atom0s. The SteamStub
  3.1 header layout, the XOR chain, and the AES-256-CBC decryption with its
  self-encrypted IV in `src/steamstub.cpp` follow the Steamless x64 unpacker.
- [Goldberg Steam Emulator](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator)
  by Mr_Goldberg. Its collection of Steamworks SDK headers, one per interface
  version, is where the vtable slot numbers in `src/steam_api64.cpp` come from.
- Valve's Steamworks SDK, which those headers originate from.
